## Introduction

I am an enthusiastic **Computer Systems** student going through last year of college, with a strong passion for computer programming and architecture, web development, data engineering and maths.

I also have a background in bioscience, really passionate about molecular biology, epigenetics and that sort of thing (actually, about anything related to science and data!). Especially regarding its convergence with tech, that is what brought me here and made a 180 degree turn in my professional vocation.

## What am I working on at the moment?

Actively engaged in the professional internship project to obtain my bachelor's degree as well as personal projects focused on programming, web development, Content Management Systems and computer networks, while I continue my training in applied maths, statistics and tech stacks to direct my future studies towards Data Science and Data Engineering. Further updates coming soon.

As part of my professionalization practices, I am collaborating in a team project on the analysis, development and deployment of a comprehensive information system for managing vehicle leasing operations associated with corporate fleets: **Rocket**. Rocket is built using PHP and MySQL, leveraging advanced web technologies. 

If you're interested in learning a little more about my work at Rocket, you can check out a short demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7q7Fa-jCQA&ab_channel=Nicol%C3%A1sServid%C3%ADo). It is in Spanish but you will be able to understand the content perfectly. I can also translate that for you if you wish!
