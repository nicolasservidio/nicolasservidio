## Introduction

Software Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, software engineering, and Agile practices. Final-semester Computer Systems student passionate about building scalable, user-focused applications using PHP, Java, and the Microsoft .NET ecosystem. I combine technical expertise with analytical rigor and a commitment to continuous learning, driven by the intersection of technology and problem-solving.

My expertise spans analysis, design, and development of computer and information systems, combining strategic thinking with technical execution. I am proficient in PHP, Java, C#, Python, other programming languages and modern web technologies - with a growing focus in backend engineering and robust application development using PHP, Java, and the Microsoft .NET ecosystem.

My academic training has equipped me with solid foundations and skills in Software & Web Development, Databases, Computer Networks and Operating Systems, addressing areas ranging from full-stack development and software architecture and design patterns to systems modeling and database management, while focusing on the principles of software engineering, functional analysis, business analysis and Agile methodologies.

**Additional Interests & Cross-Disciplinary Background:** I am an enthusiast of operating systems, Arduino and IoT, FinTech and finance in general, and have a formal background in biological sciences (molecular biology, genetics, cell biology and so on), field in which my main focus was on health, BioMed and BioTech.

This breadth of interests, academic training and professional development across diverse domains provides a distinct and highly valuable advantage, enabling me to integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge into software engineering with a refined perspective on systems, data, and innovation. I want to bring a unique perspective shaped by interdisciplinary exposure. This cross-domain experience strengthens my analytical rigor and ability to innovate at the intersection of informatics, data, and real-world challenges.

First and foremost, I am deeply passionate about hard work, continuous learning, analytical thinking, and driven by entrepreneurial ambition. Actively seeking opportunities to grow as a software developer in dynamic, impact-driven environments.

## What am I working on at the moment?

Actively engaged in the professional internship project to obtain my bachelor's degree as well as personal projects focused on programming, web development, Content Management Systems and computer networks, while I continue my training in applied maths, statistics and tech stacks to direct my future studies towards Data Science and Data Engineering. Further updates coming soon.

As part of my professionalization practices, I am collaborating in a team project on the analysis, design, development and deployment of a comprehensive information system for managing vehicle leasing operations associated with corporate fleets: **Rocket**. Rocket is built using PHP and MySQL, leveraging advanced web technologies. 

If you're interested in learning a little more about my work at Rocket, you can check out a short demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7q7Fa-jCQA&ab_channel=Nicol%C3%A1sServid%C3%ADo). It is in Spanish but you will be able to understand the content perfectly. I can also translate that for you if you wish!

## Future Plans

Devote myself ad aeternum to the research and development of cutting-edge computing technologies, improving my experience in the fields of computer science and systems engineering, software development and data science üëæ
