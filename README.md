## What am I working on at the moment?

Actively engaged in the professional internship project to obtain my bachelor's degree as well as personal projects focused on programming, web development, Content Management Systems and computer networks, while I continue my training in applied maths, statistics and tech stacks to direct my future studies towards Data Science and Data Engineering. Further updates coming soon.

As part of my professionalization practices, I am collaborating in a team project on the analysis, design, development and deployment of a comprehensive information system for managing vehicle leasing operations associated with corporate fleets: **Rocket**. Rocket is built using PHP and MySQL, leveraging advanced web technologies. 

If you're interested in learning a little more about my work at Rocket, you can check out a short demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7q7Fa-jCQA&ab_channel=Nicol%C3%A1sServid%C3%ADo). It is in Spanish but you will be able to understand the content perfectly. I can also translate that for you if you wish!

## Future Plans

Devote myself ad aeternum to the research and development of cutting-edge computing technologies, improving my experience in the fields of computer science and systems engineering, software development and data science üëæ
